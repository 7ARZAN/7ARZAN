👋 HELLO WORLD! I’m TARZAN 🦍

  


  A stupid coder swinging through DevOps jungles, building CI/CD pipelines and automating chaos!
About Me 🛠️Hey, I’m Tarzan (aka [Your Real Name]), a recent graduate from [Your School/42 School] with a passion for DevOps and system automation. I write "stupid codes" that somehow work, and I’m hunting for a DevOps internship to learn, break stuff (in a controlled way), and help teams scale their systems. My projects are a mix of low-level optimization and DevOps experiments, and I’m excited to dive into real-world challenges!
🎓 Education: [Your Degree/Program, e.g., Computer Science at 42 School]🌟 Focus Areas: CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Containerization, Cloud Automation🛠️ Tools I’m Taming: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, AWS, Jenkins📫 Reach Me: elakhfif@proton.me | LinkedIn | Twitter⚡ Fun Fact: I still don’t understand my own code half the time, but it runs! 😅🎯 Goal: Land a DevOps internship to automate the world, one pipeline at a time
Skills ⚙️My DevOps toolkit is growing, and here’s what I’m swinging with:




Featured Projects 📦Check out my "stupid codes" that actually do cool DevOps stuff:
